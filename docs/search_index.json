I will first give a brief overview of the method and then discuss a few case studies. For the hands-on part of the tutorial, we will use R as well as Flachâ€™s (2017) collostructions package. Note that the collostructions package is not (yet) available from CRAN. Please follow the installation instructions on the website to install it.

Collostructional anlysis is a family of methods measuring associations and dissociations between (usually) words and (synactic) constructions. Its theoretical background is Construction Grammar, a theory of language that assumes that language can be exhaustively described as an inventory of form-meaning pairs. These form-meaning pairs are called constructions and exist at various levels of abstraction. For collostructional analysis, so-called partially filled constructions are particularly relevant, i.e. patterns with a lexically fixed part and a variable slot. Classic examples include idiomatic patterns like [X waiting to happen] or [The X-er the Y-er], but the method can be applied to much more abstract constructions as well (e.g. imperatives, discussed in Stefanowitsch &amp; Gries 2003). Collostructional analysis comes in four major variants: Simple collexeme analysis. This variant checks which slot fillers occur at above-chance level in one open slot of a construction, compared to the frequency of the same slot fillers in all other constructions. It is therefore particularly well-suited for patterns with one open slot, e.g. [X waiting to happen]. "]]
