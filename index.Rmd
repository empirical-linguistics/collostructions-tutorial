# Introduction

This tutorial provides a very short introduction to collostructional analysis, a family of methods that has been proposed by Stefanowitsch & Gries (2003, 2005) and Gries & Stefanowitsch (2004) and that has been widely adopted in corpus-based studies couched in a Construction Grammar framework. To illustrate how these methods can be used, I draw on the example of so-called "snowclones", formulaic patterns with open slots that have attracted much attention in recent research on linguistic creativity (see [this preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/y6a8g) for a discussion of the concept).

I will first give a brief overview of the method and then discuss a few case studies. For the hands-on part of the tutorial, we will use  [R](https://r-project.org) as well as Flach's (2021) [collostructions](https://sfla.ch/collostructions/) package. Note that the collostructions package is not (yet) available from CRAN. Please follow the installation instructions on the website to install it.
